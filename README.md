# ðŸ©¸ Enhancing Donor Acquisition by Optimizing Registration via User-Centered Design

This is the repository for the thesis project "Enhancing Donor Acquisition by Optimizing Registration via User-Centered Design" completed by Nataliia Chaika under the supervision of Katya Kamyanets.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on improving the donor registration flow of DonorUA, Ukraineâ€™s leading blood donation platform. The goal is to enhance the user experience of potential blood donors by removing friction in the registration process and aligning the service with user needs and expectations.

The redesign is based on **user-centered design** and **design thinking** principles and draws on qualitative and quantitative UX research methods. The outcome is a redesigned developer-ready prototype of the registration flow validated through user testing.
